Updated As: `11/11/2019`

== Introduction

Our desktop application SpongeBob, is a Command Line Interface (CLI)  based assistant which helps in managing the locker system of NUS SoC (School of Computing) Club. As of now, the club members use various generic platforms like Google Docs, Microsoft Excel, Outlook to manage the club’s locker and thus lack integration. SpongeBob tries to solve this problem by providing a “all-in-one” solution to manage the allocation of lockers, details of renters, changes to lockers at a location and zone, status of lockers and reminders on deadline of locker rental . Having an easy-to-use yet useful locker management system, we hope to make SpongeBob unique and optimized for SoC club.


== Quick Start

. Ensure that you have Java 11 or later installed in your computer.
. You can download the latest SpongeBob.jar https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-1/main/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as your home folder for SpongeBob.
. Open terminal and type ```java -jar [CS2113T-F11-1][SpongeBob].jar```. The CLI will start in a few seconds +
+

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addLocker s/SERIALNUMBER`, `SERIALNUMBER` is a parameter which can be used as `addLocker s/1234`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [c/CONDITION]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/in-use` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME i/ID`, `i/ID n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* In case a token is used multiple times in a command then its last instance is taken eg. if the command entered is `n/NAME1 n/NAME2` then
the second instance of `n/NAME2` is considered.
* All commands are case insensitive e.g `help` or `HELP` or `HeLp` will display all the commands and their usage.
====

****
[NOTE]
* Corrupted data means (not limited to) having lockers with duplicate serial numbers, a locker having a status of in-use but without usage details, a locker having a status of not-in-use, unauthorized or broken but still having usage associated with it. 
* Also you must make sure that serial number, zone and other details associated with the locker should adhere to their particular constraints

A locker serial number is unique and there should not be multiple lockers with the
